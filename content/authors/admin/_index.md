I received my Ph.D. degree from Link√∂ping University, Sweden in 2018. My thesis "Visual Tracking" was awarded the biennial Best Nordic Thesis Prize. I am a researcher in the Computer Vision Lab at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

My main research interests are meta and online learning, deep probabilistic models, and generative methods. My research includes applications to visual tracking, video object segmentation, dense correspondence estimation, and super-resolution.
